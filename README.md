# Currency_Converter
How to create a currency converter with graphic interface.

I used python library PySide to make the User Interface.

The app contains 3 types of widgets :
- 2 combobox to choose the currency From and To
- 2 spinbox with the amount to convert
- 1 button "inverser devise" to reverse currency
